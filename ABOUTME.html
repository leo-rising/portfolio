<h2>Recent Work</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I made a thing with a classmate in Scratch last week. It's a simple side-scroller game, in which you try not to die (as is the goal in most games). The only catch is that touching /anything/ will kill you.</p>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<h2>6.30.17</h2>
<h3>How are you trying to make your website accessible to all users?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">There isn't much on this site right now, but I'm using very basic code so that it will (hopefully) load on all devices.</p>
<h3>What things did you find other people using on their websites that looked cool to you? How did they do it?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I saw my classmates were using CSS templates to beautify their sites. I'm hoping to experiment with CSS myself next week, so I can make this website look a little nicer.</p>
<h3>What are you most proud of learning so far?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I'm very much enjoying learning how to use HTML to build webpages, and I think I'm proudest of learning to tackle new, previously unknown techniques head-on, instead of trying too hard to understand every aspect of everything before proceeding.</p>
<br>

<h2>7.5.17</h2> 
<h3>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some similarities between Python and Scratch? What are some differences?</h3>  
<p style="font-family:verdana">I've noticed similarities between the structure of Python and Scratch. I feel like learning Scratch's syntax helped set us up for learning Python's (as in, they're both rather strict at times). I feel like Scratch is easier to navigate visually, but that's kind of why it was invented.</p>
<h3>Today, you likely had to spend time debugging your program. How did that feel? What did you like about it? What was hard?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I feel like the hardest part about debugging is finding out what exactly went wrong with the program, and how to fix it. Fortunately, if there's a syntax error, Python tells you which line it occurred at, which saves you a lot of trouble. I found myself mostly guessing at what needed to be fixed, but in the end, I was able to work things out.</p>  
<br>

 <h2>7.6.17.</h2>
 <h3> [ just write about what was easy and what was hard today ]</h3>
 <p style="font-family:verdana">I really enjoyed the adventure of creating a text-adventure game today. I loved our team vibe, and how we were able to laugh about anything and everything. Trying to perfect the indentations in all our nested loops was difficult, though. That wasn't so funny.</p>
