<h2>Recent Work</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I made a thing with a classmate in Scratch last week. It's a simple side-scroller game, in which you try not to die (as is the goal in most games). The only catch is that touching /anything/ will kill you.</p>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<h2>6.30.17</h2>
<h3>How are you trying to make your website accessible to all users?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">There isn't much on this site right now, but I'm using very basic code so that it will (hopefully) load on all devices.</p>
<h3>What things did you find other people using on their websites that looked cool to you? How did they do it?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I saw my classmates were using CSS templates to beautify their sites. I'm hoping to experiment with CSS myself next week, so I can make this website look a little nicer.</p>
<h3>What are you most proud of learning so far?</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I'm very much enjoying learning how to use HTML to build webpages, and I think I'm proudest of learning to tackle new, previously unknown techniques head-on, instead of trying too hard to understand every aspect of everything before proceeding.</p>
